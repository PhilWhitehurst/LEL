=======================================================================
A simple, responsive theme built on Bootstrap with support for WooCommerce &amp; bbPress
=======================================================================

Nudie is a simple, no-nonsense theme designed by professionals for the WordPress publishing platform.

Built on the latest Bootstrap 3.3 front-end framework, Nudie is robust and easy to use and takes a KISS ("keep it simple, stupid") approach so that you can worry less about the setup and more about your content, products and community.

The theme works seamlessly out of the box with popular plugins like WooCommerce and bbPress (for creating stores and building your community online).

============================================
KEY FEATURES
============================================

* Responsive / Mobile First Design - Built using the mobile first design approach on the popular Bootstrap framework, the theme looks great on Mobile, Tablet and Desktop devices.
* Minimal Theme Options - Consistent with the WordPress philosophy of "Decisions, Not Options", we believe that you shouldn't have to set a million and one options just to get a site up and running. Nudie is designed with minimal setup in mind.
* One or Two Column Page Layouts - Nudie provides the ability to set a page to be either one or two column (with content on the left or on the right).
* Plugin Friendly - Less Theme Bloat - Nudie works out of the box with a range of excellent plugins that extend your site's functionality, including Yoast's SEO plugin, Gravity Forms and SearchWP.
* Cross Browser Compatible - We've tested the theme with the latest browsers so you can be confident that your visitors are getting the best possible experience on their chosen device.
* Child Theme Ready - Want to modify, add functionality or add your own unique touch to the theme? No problems, Nudie works great as a parent theme.
* Bundled with a SAMPLE CHILD THEME
